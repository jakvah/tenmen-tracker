# tenmen-tracker
Web app for tracking and analyzing data for "10men"(tenmen) CSGO matches played with friends on the scrim service [PopFlash](https://popflash.site/). The app consists of a simple [web scraper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping), a database and a web app where the data can be viewed. The webscraper scrapes the popflash site for a given match ID, and adds the player data to the database.
