# tenmen-tracker

Python web app for tracking and analyzing match data from CSGO matches played with friends on the scrim service [PopFlash](https://popflash.site/). The [match extracion](/match_extraction) module [scrapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) the PopFlash match page and extracts the match data. The [database management](/database_management) module accepts the match data and adds it to a MySQL database. The ``__init__.py`` is the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) based Python backend interacting with the database and webscraper to present the stored matches and match data to the website. It also allows users to add their matches to be included as part of the total statistics.

A live demo of the website can be found [here](http://jakobvahlin.com/tenman)

## Dependencies
The requried dependencies for the database management module, the match extraction module and the entire Wep App are specified in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. If you want to install all the dependencies run

``` ~$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

If you only want to install the dependencies for a specific module, see the requirements.txt file for the dependencies corresponding to the module of choice.
## Hosting your own Web App

### Quickstart
Make sure you have installed the required [dependencies](#dependencies). If you are familiar with Python based web development and already have a MySQL database and Apache2 (or similar) on your server, clone this project into the folder hosting your web app. You will have to alter the login details of the database management module to match your own database. 


### Running on Ubuntu/Linux-based host system
There are several ways to host (Python based) web applications. If you are new to the field, I can recommend a [Digital Ocean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/) for hosting your web app. They will set you back $5 USD a month, however offer loads of great tutorial for beginners. To deploy the tenman-tracker Flask app, follow [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-flask-application-on-an-ubuntu-vps). Navigate to the folder hosting your web app

```~$ cd /var/www/<FlaskApp>/<FlaskApp>```

and clone the git repository into the folder

``` ~$ git clone git@github.com:jakvah/tenmen-tracker.git```
